[5:15 pm, 8/12/2024] .....: # Stock Prediction Using Twitter Data

## Project Overview
This project scrapes tweets using Tweepy and predicts stock movement based on sentiment analysis.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git

Here’s a breakdown of what I can help with immediately:

### *GitHub Repository Structure*
Here’s the *basic folder structure* for your project:

1. Download the structure template:

Using PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper), you can efficiently scrape data from subreddits like r/stocks or r/investing, which are hubs for stock market discussions and predictions.

---

### *a. Prerequisites*

1. *Create a Reddit API Account*:
   - Go to the [Reddit Developer Platform](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps).
   - Create an app and get the following credentials:
     - client_id
     - client_secret
     - user_agent

2. *Install PRAW*:
   - Install the PRAW library:
     bash
     pip install praw
     

---

### *b. Scraping Data from Reddit*

#### *1. Setting Up Authentication*
Authenticate with the Reddit API using PRAW.

python
import praw

# Reddit API credentials
client_id = "your_client_id"
client_secret = "your_client_secret"
user_agent = "your_user_agent"

# Initialize PRAW
reddit = praw.Reddit(client_id=client_id,
                     client_secret=client_secret,
                     user_agent=user_agent)


---

#### *2. Scraping Posts from Subreddits*

Use PRAW to gather posts from specific subreddits like r/stocks.

python
def scrape_reddit(subreddit_name, limit=100):
    """
    Scrapes data from the specified subreddit.
    """
    subreddit = reddit.subreddit(subreddit_name)
    posts_data = []

    for post in subreddit.hot(limit=limit):
        posts_data.append({
            "post_id": post.id,
            "title": post.title,
            "author": post.author.name if post.author else None,
            "created_at": post.created_utc,
            "score": post.score,
            "comments": post.num_comments,
            "text": post.selftext,
            "url": post.url
        })

    return posts_data

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    data = scrape_reddit("stocks", limit=50)
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    df.to_csv("data/reddit_stocks.csv", index=False)
    print("Scraped posts saved to data/reddit_stocks.csv")


---

#### *3. Scraping Comments*

If you'd like to scrape comments from a specific post:

python
def scrape_comments(post_id):
    """
    Scrapes comments from a specific Reddit post.
    """
    submission = reddit.submission(id=post_id)
    comments_data = []

    submission.comments.replace_more(limit=None)  # Load all comments
    for comment in submission.comments.list():
        comments_data.append({
            "comment_id": comment.id,
            "author": comment.author.name if comment.author else None,
            "created_at": comment.created_utc,
            "score": comment.score,
            "body": comment.body
        })

    return comments_data

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    comments = scrape_comments("post_id_here")
    comments_df = pd.DataFrame(comments)
    comments_df.to_csv("data/reddit_comments.csv", index=False)
    print("Scraped comments saved to data/reddit_comments.csv")


---

### *c. Save Data for Analysis*

- Save posts or comments as *JSON*:
  python
  import json

  with open("data/reddit_posts.json", "w") as file:
      json.dump(data, file, indent=4)

  print("Posts saved to data/reddit_posts.json")
  

- Save posts or comments as *CSV*:
  python
  import pandas as pd

  df = pd.DataFrame(data)
  df.to_csv("data/reddit_posts.csv", index=False)

  print("Posts saved to data/reddit_posts.csv")
  

---

### *d. Notes*
1. *Rate Limits*:
   - Reddit's API has rate limits, so space out requests if scraping large amounts of data.
2. *Filtering Posts*:
   - Filter posts by time range:
     python
     subreddit.top(time_filter="week", limit=50)
     
   - Common time_filter options: "all", "year", "month", "week", "day", "hour".
3. *Legal Compliance*:
   - Follow Reddit’s [API Terms of Use](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/data-api-terms-of-use).
